\chapter{Introduction}
It is crucial for every democracy to be transparent. In Austria transparency is granted through publicly available protocols of the sessions of the national council. In these protocols every word said of each politician in all the sessions is included. Obviously, these protocols are not very meaningful only by themselves.

To visualize the activity and relations of the politicians and parliamentary clubs of the national council, in this thesis the content of the protocols are being extracted, transformed and analyzed.
