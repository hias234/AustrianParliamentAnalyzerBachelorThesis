\chapter{Introduction}
One of the most crucial requirements of a democracy is transparency. There are several ways how one can gain information about the current and past political activities in Austria. One of them are publicly available protocols of the national council sessions. In these protocols every word said is being written down and therefore they are very long and it is hard to gain meaning out of it.

To be able to analyze and visualize the activities and relations of the politicians and parties in a better way, during this thesis the protocols are being extracted, analyzed and visualized.
