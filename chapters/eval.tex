\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{chap:evaluation}

As a result of the ETL-Application a database with structured information about the national council is available now and can be used for further purposes. This database has been used for analysis and the results got visualized via a web application which is accessible for everybody. Figure \ref{fig:start_page_prototype} shows the start page of this application. Furthermore, the relation graphs of several periods get discussed in the sections \ref{sec:relations_clubs} and \ref{sec:relations_pol}.

\section{Relations of Parliament Clubs}
\label{sec:relations_clubs}
Figure \ref{fig:club_graphs1} shows the created relation graphs of the parliamentary clubs of the legislative periods 22 to 25. The graphs visualize the relations among the clubs through the distance of the nodes. The more positive the relation between two clubs is, the closer they appear together in the graph and the thicker is the edge between them. Only positive edges are shown in the graph, as the graph would look too confusing and messy if the negative edges were also shown. In all graphs shown, one can easily see that there are always two main groups of parliamentary clubs visible in the parliament: Those which are in government and those which are in opposition. In table \ref{table:gov_opp_parties} the parties are listed per period weather they were in government or in opposition. 
In the current period (25.) you can see that the governing parties (ÖVP and SPÖ) have a strong positive relationship and that there are only minor positive relationships between the governing parties and the NEOS party. All other parties in the opposition have negative relationships to the government. In period 22, a similar structure is visible, but in this period the government consists of ÖVP, FPÖ and BZÖ. This shows that the distinctness of government and opposition does not depend on the composition of the parties.

\section{Relations of Politicians}
\label{sec:relations_pol}
Similar graphs to the ones in section \ref{sec:relations_clubs} were created for politicians. Figure \ref{fig:pol_graphs1} shows this graphs for the legislative periods 22 and 25. The closer two politicians appear together in a graph, the more positive is their relation. The politician nodes are in the color of the parliamentary club, the politician belongs to in the legislative period. The edges are colored in the color of the parliamentary club, if both nodes belong to the same club.

In the resulting graphs is again visible that the government and the opposition are distinct groups. In the 25. period ÖVP (black) and SPÖ (red) are in government whereas in the 22. period ÖVP (black), FPÖ (blue) and BZÖ (orange) are in government. In both periods goverment and opposition can be visually separated. Also within government and opposition the specific clubs are close together. This effect is bigger in the opposition as the inner cohesion in the government is higher\footnote{see section \ref{fig:gov_opp_relation}}.

\section{Government - Opposition Relation}
\label{sec:gov_opp_relation}
Table \ref{table:gov_opp_relation} shows the results of the measures taken for the government-opposition relation, inner government cohesion and inner opposition cohesion. Figure \ref{fig:gov_opp_relation} shows the changes over time of these values. The values show basically that the two main groups in the parliament - the government and opposition - are highly distinct. The government-opposition relation is negative in every discussed period. This means that there is an overall tendency of politicians in government and opposition to have a different opinion. The values differ in the periods, the 20. period shows a the most negative value with $-0.85$. This means that only in $7.5$\% of the speeches a politician in government and opposition had the same opinion on a certain topic, in all other speeches they had contrary ones. In the current period, this inter relationship value is still negative, but it is a lot less negative. The relation coefficient is $-0.374$ which means that in $31.3$\% of the speeches government and opposition have the same opinion.
