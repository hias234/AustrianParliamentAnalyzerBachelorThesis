There are only a few works on analyzing political structures such as a parliament. One among them is a paper on network analysis of committees in the U.S. House of Representatives \cite{Porter_2005}. Porter and his colleagues tried to show the connections between representatives of the House and the committees and subcommittees, in which a big amount of the American legislation happens. Using techniques of network analysis they found out that there are certain correlations between communities and that there also high relations between a political position and the assignment to a committee. 

In 2012, Amelio \cite{Amelio_2012} also did a study on the voting behavior in Italy. She used multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering and network analysis.
