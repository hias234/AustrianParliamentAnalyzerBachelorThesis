In the context of computer science, there are only a few works on automatically analyzing political structures such as a parliament. In 2013, Renzo Lucioni \cite{Lucioni_2015} used publicly available voting data from the Congress of the United States of America to analyze the relationships among politicians and how distinct the two main parties are. To achieve this, he used data from the $101^{st}$ Congress through the $113^{th}$ Congress and created network graphs which graphically showed which politicians vote similar. He also showed how the structure of the Congress developed over time. His results showed that the gap between the Republicans and the Democrats - the only two really relevant parties in the USA - became larger and larger over the last decades. This means that both parties vote more and more against each other. In the context of the Austrian parliament, similar analysis can be applied, if data is available in sufficient quality. For example, it can be analyzed which parties vote similar and if there exist relations between parties which are in the government or in the opposition.

One among them is a paper on network analysis of committees in the U.S. House of Representatives \cite{Porter_2005}. Newman et al. and his colleagues tried to show the connections between representatives of the House and the committees and subcommittees, in which a big amount of the American legislation happens. Using techniques of network analysis they found out that there are certain correlations between communities and that there also high relations between a political position and the assignment to a committee. 

In 2012, Amelio \cite{Amelio_2012} also did a study on the voting behavior in Italy. She used multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering and network analysis.
