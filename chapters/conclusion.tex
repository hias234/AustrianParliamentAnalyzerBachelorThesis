\label{chap:conclusion}

The implemented prototype shows that it is possible to get structured data out of the stenographic transcripts in good quality and that sophisticated analysis can be performed on the basis of this information. The applied analysis can give an overview of politician absence, length of serving in the national council, politician activity, the relation between politicians/clubs and the inner cohesion of coalition or opposition. Especially the latter analysis of the relationships among parliamentary clubs/politicians brought interesting results. The relation graphs showed that in the national council of the Austrian parliament, there are always two groups of politicians/clubs: Government and opposition. The analysis of inner cohesion of government and opposition and the overall relation between these two groups confirmed this fact.

While the results of the analysis visualized interesting facts, there is still a lot work which can be done. With the existing data, politicians can be clustered to find groups and subgroups in the national council automatically, similar to the work of Porter and Newman \cite{Porter_2005}. Furthermore, sentiment analysis could be applied on the texts of the speeches in the parliament to automatically find out whether a speech was positive or negative. This could help to improve the calculation of the relation weights and therefore also result in better graphs. Another potential future work can be the extraction of data from the federal council and other chambers of the political system in Austria and to combine them with the current data to gain connections between the different chambers and to be able to discover political structures in a broader context.
