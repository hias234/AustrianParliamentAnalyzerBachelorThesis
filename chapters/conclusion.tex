The implemented prototype shows that it is possible to get structured data out of the stenographic transcripts and that analysis can be performed on the basis of this data. The analysis can give an overview of politician absence, length of serving in the national council, politician activity, the relation between politicians/clubs and the inner cohesion of coalition or opposition.
