The implemented prototype shows that it is possible to get structured data out of the stenographic transcripts in good quality and that sophisticated analysis can be performed on the basis of this information. The analysis can give an overview of politician absence, length of serving in the national council, politician activity, the relation between politicians/clubs and the inner cohesion of coalition or opposition. Especially the latter analysis of the relationship among parliamentary clubs and politician brought interesting results and the resulting graphs showed that in the national council of the Austrian parliament, there are always two groups of politicians (and clubs): Government and opposition.
