\label{chap:conclusion}

The implemented prototype shows that it is possible to get structured data out of the stenographic transcripts in good quality and that sophisticated analysis can be performed on the basis of this information. The applied analysis can give an overview of politician absence, length of serving in the national council, politician activity, the relation between politicians/clubs and the inner cohesion of coalition or opposition. Especially the latter analysis of the relationships among parliamentary clubs/politicians brought interesting results. The relation graphs showed that in the national council of the Austrian parliament, there are always two groups of politicians/clubs: Government and opposition. The analysis of inner cohesion of government and opposition and the overall relation between these two groups confirmed this fact.

While the results of the analysis visualized interesting facts, there is still a lot work which can be done. With the existing data, clustering of politicians can be applied to find groups in the national council automatically. These groups can also be subgroups within government and opposition.
